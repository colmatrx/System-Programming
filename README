This program reads log messages from the user via standard input. The maximum number of characters in the log is 1000.

The user is allowed to provide a line of message terminated by the enter key.

The user is next asked to provide the type of message.

If the user invokes the program without any argument, the logfile is saved to disk as "Messages.log"

If user invokes the program with a filename, the filename is used as the logfile name on disk.

########### Issues Encountered ##############

Even though I used a linked list to log the messages, I could not retrieve the message string from the linked correctly from each node.

Therefore I improvised by storing the structure as a concatenated string in a separate variable and using that variable pointer to save to disk.
